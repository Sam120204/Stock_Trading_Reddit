### Workflow with Reddit analysis

#### Google Cloud Function:
1. **Fetch Reddit posts and comments**:
   - Utilize the Reddit API to gather posts and comments from specified subreddits.

2. **Generate embeddings using BERT**:
   - Convert the text of posts and comments into dense vector representations that capture their semantic meaning.

3. **Perform sentiment analysis using VADER**:
   - Calculate sentiment scores for the text of posts and comments to gauge their emotional tone.

4. **Store data in PostgreSQL**:
   - Save the raw text, embeddings, sentiment scores, and other relevant information (like timestamps, scores, and URLs) in a PostgreSQL database.

#### Periodic Export for Training:
1. **Export data from PostgreSQL to JSON files**:
   - Periodically query the PostgreSQL database to retrieve stored data, including raw text, embeddings, and sentiment scores.
   - Convert this data into JSON format and save it to files.

2. **Use JSON files to train your model**:
   - Load the JSON files into your training environment.
   - Preprocess the data as necessary and use it to train your machine learning model, leveraging the rich features provided by the raw text, embeddings, and sentiment scores.
