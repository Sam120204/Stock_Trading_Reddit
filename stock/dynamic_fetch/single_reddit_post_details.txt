selftext: If not can someone explain how the hell TSLA can moon indefinitely while actually profitable stocks like TSM and NVDA has literally been stuck forever at the same price for the past 2 months despite numerous positive earnings and news?

Like literally none of this makes a single bit of sense whatsoever. At all. And ASTS just had a disastrous news on an accident and that stock freaking mooned instead. Boeing just got sued and is liable for criminal charges and stock went up abit too. What the goddamn hell????

Are we supposed to just reverse everything now, cos that's what institutions are doing? Good stock news? Be bearish and sell. Bad stock news? BUY!

Is that it???

Comment ID: ldbso0u, Body: Fundamental analysis is just getting more difficult to actually build processes on. Consider Goldhart‚Äôs law: as soon as a measure of success becomes a target, it fails to be a good measure of success. Once a good investing strategy based on fundamentals are discovered, it gets played out and meta strategies spawn out of the trend that creates. There will always be some combination of fundamental analysis and personal discretion that works, but the level of difficulty in the analysis necessary to understand the market at any given point is varied and dependent on chaotic factors, Score: 9, Created: 2024-07-15 18:17:11

Comment ID: ldbppid, Body: OP's regardation is confirmed with his NVDA comment, but for real. Fundamentals literally do not matter and have not been predictive for 15 years. See my flair, you know how much money I've lost on shorting overpriced trash?

The only things that matter are total market liquidity (M2 or M0) for indices and momentum for individual stocks. The market won't go down because the Fed won't let it go down, and the only thing limiting it upwards is the amount of money in the economy that's available to invest.

The Fed has essentially nationalized SPY and made it into the American sovereign pension fund. The stock market isn't an actual market any more, it's more like a second Social Security program., Score: 3, Created: 2024-07-15 18:01:17

This guy uses his little credibility in a field to promote a lot of false stuff and sell BS. This guy is a joke. If you want to link grown up opinions look at actual papers and comments on them. If you didn't know for example the Bogdanoff brothers have multiple gibberish science papers that are widely regarded as jokes so looking at some surface level marketing show is not really great adult behaviour. At least for visual science his contribution is legit after that he went off the rails for some reason.
