# Developing a Similar API to Ape Wisdom

## Overview
In addition to the features mentioned above, we are building a similar API to Ape Wisdom that predicts stock trends based on social media sentiment, particularly from Reddit posts and comments. This involves using machine learning algorithms and various tools for data processing and model deployment.

## Tools and Algorithms

### Data Collection
- **PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper):** To fetch Reddit posts and comments.
- **Ape Wisdom API:** For fetching trending stocks and cryptocurrencies.

### Data Preprocessing
- **pandas:** For data manipulation.
- **nltk, TextBlob, or VADER:** For sentiment analysis to detect if the posts or comments are positive, negative, or neutral.

### Feature Engineering
- **pandas:** For creating features such as mentions, day, month, year, and sentiment score.

### Machine Learning Model
- **scikit-learn:** For training machine learning models like Linear Regression to predict stock prices based on the features.
1. Random Forest Regressor: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html

### Database
- **MongoDB:** To store and manage collected data.

### API Development
- **Flask:** To create a web API for the machine learning model.
- **Docker:** To containerize the application for easy deployment.

## Steps to Develop the API

### Data Collection
1. Fetch posts and comments from Reddit using PRAW.
2. Retrieve trending stocks and cryptocurrencies using Ape Wisdom API.

### Data Preprocessing
1. Clean and preprocess the collected data.
2. Perform sentiment analysis to determine the sentiment of each post/comment.

### Feature Engineering
1. Create features from the processed data.

### Model Training
1. Split the data into training and testing sets.
2. Train a machine learning model to predict stock trends.

### API Development
1. Develop a Flask API to expose the trained model.
2. Containerize the application using Docker.

### Deployment
1. Deploy the containerized application to a cloud platform for public access.

## Usage
For now, you can use the existing project in the `apewisdom` directory to predict stock trends using the Ape Wisdom API and Reddit Post API. The new API being developed in the `testing` directory will offer similar functionality with additional features and improvements.

### How Random Forest Regressor Analyzes Posts and Comments

The Random Forest Regressor itself doesn't directly determine whether a poster or commenter is "right" or "wrong" in their predictions about stock prices. Instead, it uses the features derived from the posts and comments to predict future stock prices or trends. Hereâ€™s how it works step-by-step:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - **Sentiment Analysis:** Each post and comment is analyzed for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). This gives a sentiment score.
   - **Feature Extraction:** Other features are extracted, such as the number of mentions of a particular stock ticker, the length of the post, the time of the post, etc.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - The sentiment scores, number of mentions, and other relevant features are combined into a structured dataset. Each row represents a post or comment, and each column represents a feature.

3. **Model Training:**
   - **Input Features:** The features derived from the posts and comments are used as inputs (independent variables).
   - **Target Variable:** The historical stock prices or trends serve as the target variable (dependent variable).

### Steps for Random Forest Regressor

1. **Training Phase:**
   - **Random Forest Algorithm:** This algorithm creates multiple decision trees using random subsets of the data and features.
   - **Aggregation:** Each tree makes its prediction, and the Random Forest aggregates these predictions (e.g., by averaging them in regression tasks).

2. **Prediction Phase:**
   - **New Data:** For new posts and comments, the same features are extracted and fed into the trained Random Forest model.
   - **Aggregated Prediction:** The model aggregates the predictions from its multiple trees to provide a final predicted stock price or trend.

### Key Points on Analyzing Posts and Comments

- **Sentiment as a Proxy:** Sentiment scores derived from text can be a proxy for market sentiment. For example, a high sentiment score might indicate positive market sentiment towards a stock, which could correlate with an increase in stock price.
- **Feature Importance:** Random Forest provides a measure of feature importance, helping to understand which features (e.g., sentiment score, number of mentions) are most predictive of stock price movements.
- **Non-linear Relationships:** Random Forest can capture complex non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable, which is crucial in financial predictions where relationships are rarely purely linear.

### Example Explanation

Let's illustrate this with a simplified example:

1. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - A post with the title "GME to the moon! ðŸš€ðŸš€" and content "GME is going to skyrocket because of strong fundamentals and community support!" might get a high positive sentiment score.
   - A comment with "I'm not sure about GME, seems overvalued to me." might get a neutral or negative sentiment score.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - From the above post: `mentions = 1`, `sentiment = 0.8` (highly positive)
   - From the above comment: `mentions = 1`, `sentiment = -0.2` (somewhat negative)

3. **Model Training:**
   - Historical data shows that positive sentiment in the past has often correlated with price increases.
   - The model learns that posts with high sentiment scores and many mentions are often followed by an increase in stock prices.

4. **Prediction:**
   - New post: "GME is the best stock out there!"
   - Extracted features: `mentions = 1`, `sentiment = 0.9`
   - The model uses these features to predict that GME's stock price is likely to increase, based on patterns learned from historical data.

### Conclusion

The Random Forest Regressor doesn't directly determine if a poster or commenter is "right" or "wrong." Instead, it analyzes patterns in the data (features extracted from posts and comments) to predict future stock trends. The effectiveness of this prediction depends on the quality and relevance of the features used, such as sentiment scores and mentions of stock tickers.
